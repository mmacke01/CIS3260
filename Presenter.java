        until the win condition is met, or the player chooses to exit the game. Each 
        iteration of the loop is a turn. The loop will run as follows:
        - Call to GetInput() to get which piece the player is selecting.
        - Call to FindValidMoves() to find all valid moves the player can make with the piece and update that on the board.
        - Call to GetInput to find which tile the player wishes to move his or her piece to.
        - Call to MovePiece() to move the selected piece to the selected destination.
        - Call to CheckWin() to check if the player has won the game with that move.
        - Toggle player
        - Display updated board from new playerâ€™s perspective.
